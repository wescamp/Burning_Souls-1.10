            story= _ "One day in the year of 871 YW, a band of merfolk were passing by Bilheld and Kilashi, thinking they were trying to cause trouble, led some hand picked drakes to crush them. The battle was quick, the drakes swooped down upon the fish-men and burned them with their firey breath, the merfolk were defeated soon afterwards, quickly and easily."

            story= _ "All seemed fine for a while, but only a month later the drakes saw more merfolk, they swam in vast numbers toward Bilheld, and Kilashi prepared for battle once again. Not knowing that this battle, would be his last."

        [part]
            story= _ "Apparently, The small party of fish-men the drakes killed earlier was graced by the presence of a Kai's son. The young prince fell in battle at a drakes blade, and now the Kai himself was leading the largest army of merfolk to avenge his son. The battle was long, hard, bloody, and unfortunate. The drakes lost their fearless leader to a merman spear that was plunged into his heart by the merfolk king; Kai Fagriz."

        [part]
            story= _ "Both the mermen and drakes fought on after the death of Kilashi. The drakes burned many of the fish-people with their inner flame, and their hearts of rage. Rage caused by the death of their dominant. The battle eventually ended with the invader's defeat. The merfolk melted back into the waters from where they came, and retreated. The Kai's son had been avenged, and the drakes had payed an unfair price for their mistake."

        [part]
            story= _ "Dark times rose when Kilashi fell. But it wasn't just the death of Kilashi, it was the many deaths of all the drakes who fought, and died heroicly in the battle. A year has passed now, and Bilheld still remains with no leader, and hardly a population - to make matters worse, a new danger is about to arrive..."
